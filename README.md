This is an end-to-end Machine Learning project for detecting phishing websites using network and URL-based features.
I built an automated data science pipeline covering data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
The system selects the best-performing model and serializes it for production use.
The final model is deployed as a web application/API for real-time predictions.
This project demonstrates a complete production-style ML workflow.
